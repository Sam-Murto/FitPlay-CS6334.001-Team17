Hello, welcome the the fitboxing tutorial. (Press A to continue)
You'll learn the basic method to play this game here.
Hold your controllers, then raise them inside your camera. 
Can you see two white cubes on the controllers?
In fact, that's your punching gloves. 
It will be replaced by a pair of more REAL gloves later.
Use your joysticks to move around. 
Do you see the big golden capsule in front of you?
 You could try to walk near it and punch it.
Did you see the red bar and boss name pop up after you punch it? 
The red bar is the boss' HP bar.
And yes, this capsule is your first boss. It's name is Daruma Kun. 
Punch it harder to deal more damage. Try to defeat it!
Then, please turn left. There is another white capsule here. 
Try to walk to it.
It's a more typical sandbag, hanging on a stick.
You may have already anticipated this. It's your second boss, Alexandros. 
Defeat it to gain the honor!
You did it! 
You defeated two evil and powerful bosses, winning wealth and honor. 
The tutorial is end. Thanks for your participation!
