## Game Descriptions

### FitBoxing
<p> In FitBoxing, the player faces an basic AI boxing opponent that attempts to punch the player, or will attempt to close distance on the player if they are too far away.
  The player must block the opponent's punches to avoid taking damage and then punch the opponent back to decrease their health. Once the opponent's health is 0, the player
 has won. </p>

### FitSaber
<p> FitSaber is a basic Beat Saber clone. Obstacles, strikeable objects, and bombs will fly at the player and the player must interact with them correctly in order 
to increase their score. Obstacles must be avoided by the player's hitbox, strikeable objects must be struck in the correct direction, and bombs must not be 
struck by the sabers. </p>

### FitRunning
<p> FitRunning is a time trial game in which the player must run through a level with basic obstacles along with coins that will increase their score. The player must move 
through the level by actually running in place </p>
